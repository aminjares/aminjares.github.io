### Case Study: Heroku

In Heroku.com, Heroku's platform is designed to maximize the developer's productivity and provide the developer with a good experience of learning the capabilities of Heroku. Heroku extends this platform with a range of tools that support modern development practices, such as continuous delivery. Continuous delivery features short release cycles, automation, and a direct connection to the source code repository. Continuous delivery is designed to keep teams updated constant to production  safe with less time. Heroku flow is a cycle that sends out workflow that combines actons with GitHub, visually presented pipelines, disposable “review apps” and Heroku CI. Heroku Flow is designed to streamline the app release experience by making continuous delivery easy, visual, and efficient. 
A pipeline is a group of Heroku apps that each repsents either deployment, review, staging, or production. pipeline comes in handy when managing multiple environments for a app by following the five steps. First, the developer creates a pull request to make a change to the codebase. Second, Heroku automatically creates a review app for the pull request that allows the developers to test the change. Third, after the change is complete it will merge into the codebase’s master branch. Fourth, the master branch is automatically sented to the pipeline’s staging app for additional testing. Last, a developer promotes the staging app to production to make it available to the app’s end users. Pipelines let the developer know how the deployed code flows from one environment to the next.
